GENERAL ALLEGATIONS  Overview Of The Case  A. The Risk Of Artificial General Intelligence  15. Over the course of the 20th century, the Un ited States gradually shifted from a  primarily human labor-based economy to a primarily human knowledge-based economy, with economic value increasingly created primarily by human intelligence. As the century progressed,      – 4 –  COMPLAINT    another paradigm shift was already underway: value creation through artificial intelligence (AI).  Early AI programs were capable of outperforming humans in certain discrete tasks. Almost immediately after the invention of the programmable computer, AI could show super-human performance on a highly formalized problem like finding the fastest path through a network of roads. It took longer for AI to reach superiority for problems requiring more creativity. In 1996, IBM’s Deep Blue AI program beat Gary Kasparov, the then-world champion in chess. These programs, while useful, were essentially one-trick-ponies—their intelligence was not general. Deep Blue had massive arrays of processors that could only play chess. Algorithms for path finding could solve a maze or route a car, but they could not paint a painting.   16. Starting in the late 2000s and early 2010s, an older algorithm called deep learning  became practical to implement on low-cost hardware for the first time. This caused an almost overnight revolution in performance across nearly all AI projects. New, top of class algorithms were developed for turning speech into text, translating between languages, and recognizing what kind of food is shown in a photo. One of the hallmarks of deep learning is that algorithms do not need to be designed with significant knowledge of the task at hand. They learn each task from training examples, essentially programming themselves. This means that they are far more general-purpose than earlier systems like Deep Blue.  17. As deep learning algorithms became increasingly sophisticated, some of the world’s  leading AI researchers set their sights on what has come to be called Artificial General Intelligence  (AGI). The basic concept of AGI is a general purpose artificial intelligence system—a machine having intelligence for a wide variety of tasks like a human.   18. Mr. Musk has long recognized that AGI poses a grave threat to humanity—perhaps  the greatest existential threat we face today. His concerns mirrored those raised before him by luminaries like Stephen Hawking and Sun Microsystems founder Bill Joy. Our entire economy is based around the fact that humans work together and come up with the best solutions to a hard task. If a machine can solve nearly any task better than we can, that machine becomes more economically useful than we are. As Mr. Joy warned, with strong AGI, the future doesn’t need us. Mr. Musk    – 5 –  COMPLAINT    publicly called for a variety of measures to address the dangers of AGI, from voluntary moratoria  to regulation, but his calls largely fell on deaf ears.   19. But where some like Mr. Musk see an existential threat in AGI, others see AGI as a  source of profit and power.   20. In 2014, Google acquired DeepMind, a research group focused on deep learning.  One of DeepMind’s initial developments was AlphaZero, a chess playing algorithm. Unlike previous algorithms, however, AlphaZero used reinforcement learning, wherein the program learns to play chess by playing itself with different versions of the software. It starts by playing randomly, with no understanding of the game’s strategy. When one version of the software wins a game against another, the winning program’s internal pathways are reinforced and the process repeats.   21. AlphaZero rapidly became the strongest chess playing system in the world.  Shockingly, it was also announced that the same program was also the strongest in the world for playing two other extremely difficult games. In Google/DeepMind’s words, Starting from random play, and given no domain knowledge except the game rules, AlphaZero achieved within 24 hours a superhuman level of play in the games of chess and shogi (Japanese chess) as well as Go, and convincingly defeated a world-champion program in each case.  22. With the DeepMind team, Google immediately catapulted to the front of the race for  AGI. Mr. Musk was deeply troubled by this development. He believed (and still does) that in the hands of a closed, for-profit company like Google, AGI poses a particularly acute and noxious danger to humanity. In 2014, it was already difficult enough to compete with Google in its core businesses. Google had collected a uniquely large set of data from our searches, our emails, and nearly every book in our libraries. Nevertheless, up to this point, everyone had the potential to compete with Google through superior human intelligence and hard work. AGI would make competition nearly impossible.  B. The Founding Agreement Of OpenAI, Inc.  23. Mr. Altman purported to share Mr. Musk’s concerns over the threat posed by AGI.  In 2015, Mr. Altman wrote that the [d]evelopment of superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) is    – 6 –  COMPLAINT    probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity. There are other threats that I  think are more certain to happen . . . but are unlikely to destroy every human in the universe in the way that SMI could. Later that same year, Mr. Altman approached Mr. Musk with a proposal: that they join forces to form a non-profit AI lab that would try to catch up to Google in the race for AGI, but it would be the opposite of Google.   24. Together with Mr. Brockman, the three agreed that this new lab: (a) would be a non- profit developing AGI for the benefit of humanity, not for a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits; and (b) would be open-source, balancing only countervailing safety considerations, and would not keep its technology closed and secret for proprietary commercial reasons (The Founding Agreement). Reflecting the Founding Agreement, Mr. Musk named this new AI lab OpenAI, which would compete with, and serve as a vital counterbalance to, Google/DeepMind in the race for AGI, but would do so to benefit humanity, not the shareholders of a private, for-profit company (much less one of the largest technology companies in the world).   25. The Founding Agreement was also memorialized, among other places, in OpenAI,  Inc.’s December 8, 2015 Certificate of Incorporation, which affirmed that its resulting technology  will benefit the public and the corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person. Ex. 1 at 1. The Certificate of Incorporation further affirmed that all of the corporation’s property was irrevocably dedicated to these agreed purposes. Id.  26. In reliance on the Founding Agreement, which Mr. Altman, Mr. Brockman, and  OpenAI, Inc. reaffirmed with Mr. Musk on multiple occasions, Mr. Musk was a moving force behind the creation of OpenAI, Inc. contributing a majority of its funding in its first several years, advising on research directions, and most importantly, recruiting some of the world’s leading scientists and engineers to work at the non-profit venture, including Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. Recruiting for OpenAI, Inc. was a Herculean task in the face of relentless recruiting efforts by Google/DeepMind, coupled with the lavish compensation Google/DeepMind offered. There would have been no OpenAI, Inc. without Mr. Musk’s founding contributions and early leadership. Mr.    – 7 –  COMPLAINT    Musk continued to make contributions to OpenAI, Inc. from its founding through September 14,  2020.  27. OpenAI’s initial research was performed in the open, providing free and public  access to designs, models, and code. When OpenAI, Inc. researchers discovered that an algorithm called Transformers, initially invented by Google, could perform many natural language tasks without any explicit training, entire communities sprung up to enhance and extend the models released by OpenAI, Inc. These communities spread to open-source, grass-roots efforts and commercial entities alike.   28. Mr. Altman became OpenAI, Inc.’s CEO in 2019. On September 22, 2020, OpenAI  entered into an agreement with Microsoft, exclu sively licensing to Microsoft its Generative Pre- Trained Transformer (GPT)-3 language model. However, OpenAI published a detailed paper describing the internals and training data for GPT-3, enabling the community to create similar models themselves. And, most critically, the Microsoft license only applied to OpenAI’s pre-AGI technology. Microsoft obtained no rights to AGI. And it was up to OpenAI, Inc.’s non-profit Board, not Microsoft, to determine when OpenAI attained AGI.  C. The 2023 Breach Of The Founding Agreement  29. In 2023, Defendants Mr. Altman, Mr. Brockman, and OpenAI set the Founding  Agreement aflame.   30. In March 2023, OpenAI released its most powerful language model yet, GPT-4.  GPT-4 is not just capable of reasoning. It is better at reasoning than average humans. It scored in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam for lawyers. It scored in the 99th percentile on the GRE Verbal Assessment. It even scored a 77% on the Advanced Sommelier examination. At this time, Mr. Altman caused OpenAI to radically depart from its original mission and historical practice of making its technology and knowledge available to the public. GPT-4’s internal design was kept and remains a complete secret except to OpenAI—and, on information and belief, Microsoft. There are no scientific publications describing the design of GPT-4. Instead, there are just press releases bragging about performance. On information and belief, this secrecy is primarily driven by commercial considerations, not safety. Although developed by OpenAI using contributions from    – 8 –  COMPLAINT    Plaintiff and others that were intended to benefit the public, GPT-4 is now a de facto  Microsoft  proprietary algorithm, which it has integrated into its Office software suite.   31. Furthermore, on information and belief, GPT-4 is an AGI algorithm, and hence  expressly outside the scope of Microsoft’s September 2020 exclusive license with OpenAI. In this regard, Microsoft’s own researchers have publicly stated that, [g]iven the breadth and depth of GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence ( AGI) system. Moreover, on information and belief,  OpenAI is currently developing a model known as Q (Q star) that has an even stronger claim to AGI. As noted, Microsoft only has rights to certain of OpenAI’s pre-AGI technology. But for purposes of the Microsoft license, it is up to OpenAI, Inc.’s Board to determine whether OpenAI has attained AGI, and a Board coup took place in November 2023. On November 17, 2023, OpenAI, Inc.’s Board fired Mr. Altman after losing confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI because he was not consistently candid with the board. In a series of stunning developments spanning the next several days, Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman, in concert with Microsoft, exploited Microsoft’s significant leverage over OpenAI, Inc. and forced the resignation of a majority of OpenAI, Inc.’s Board members, including Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. Mr. Altman was reinstated as CEO of OpenAI, Inc. on November 21. On information and belief, the new Board members were hand-picked by Mr. Altman and blessed by Microsoft. The new Board members lack substantial AI expertise and, on information and belief, are ill equipped by design to make an independent determination of whether and when OpenAI has attained AGI—and hence when it has developed an algorithm that is outside the scope of Microsoft’s license.   32. These events of 2023 constitute flagrant breaches of the Founding Agreement, which  Defendants have essentially turned on its head. To th is day, OpenAI, Inc.’s website continues to  profess that its charter is to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. In reality, however, OpenAI, Inc. has been transformed into a closed-source de facto subsidiary of the largest technology company  in the world: Microsoft. 1 Under its new Board, it is not just developing but is actually refining an  AGI to maximize profits for Microsoft, rather than for the benefit of humanity. Its technology,                                                    1 Microsoft’s market cap as of February 28, 2024 was $3.03 trillion.   1   – 9 –  COMPLAINT    including GPT-4, is closed-source primarily to serve the proprietary commercial interests of  Microsoft. Indeed, as the November 2023 drama was unfolding, Microsoft’s CEO boasted that it would not matter [i]f OpenAI disappeared tomorrow. He explained that [w]e have all the IP rights and all the capability. We have the people, we have the compute, we have the data, we have everything. We are below them, above them, around them.   33. This case is filed to compel OpenAI to adhere to the Founding Agreement and return  to its mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not to personally benefit the individual Defendants and the largest technology company in the world.   Detailed Allegations  A. Mr. Musk’s Concerns Over AGI Falling Into The Wrong Hands  34. In 2012, Elon Musk met Demis Hassabis, the co-founder of DeepMind, a for-profit  artificial intelligence company. On or about this time, Mr. Musk and Mr. Hassabis met at SpaceX’s factory in Hawthorne, California where Mr. Musk and Mr. Hassabis discussed the greatest threats facing society. During this conversation, Mr. Hassabis emphasized the potential dangers that the advancement of AI presents to society.      35. Following this conversation with Mr. Hassabis, Mr. Musk became increasingly  concerned about the potential of AI to become super-intelligent, surpass human intelligence, and threaten humanity. Indeed, Mr. Musk was not the only person afraid about the dangers of AI and the research being conducted at DeepMind. It has been reported that following a meeting with Mr. Hassabis and investors in DeepMind, one of the investors remarked that the best thing he could have done for the human race was shoot Mr. Hassabis then and there.  36. Mr. Musk began discussing AI and DeepMind with those in his orbit, such as Larry  Page, then-CEO of Google’s parent company Alphabet, Inc. Mr. Musk would frequently raise the dangers of AI in his conversations with Mr. Page, but to Mr. Musk’s shock, Mr. Page was unconcerned. For example, in 2013, Mr. Musk had a passionate exchange with Mr. Page about the dangers of AI. He warned that unless safeguards were put in place, artificial intelligence-systems might replace humans, making our species irrelevant or even extinct. Mr. Page responded that would merely be the next stage of evolution, and claimed Mr. Musk was being a specist—that    – 10 –  COMPLAINT    he favored the human species over intelligent machines. Mr. Musk responded, Well, yes, I am pro- human.  37. At the end of 2013, Mr. Musk learned to his grave concern that Google was planning  to acquire DeepMind. At the time, DeepMind was one of the most advanced AI companies in the industry. Thus, Mr. Musk was deeply concerned that DeepMind’s AI technology would be in the hands of someone who viewed it and its power so cavalierly, and could hide its design and capabilities behind closed doors.   38. In an effort to prevent this powerful technology from falling into Google’s hands,  Mr. Musk and Luke Nosek, a co-founder of PayPal, attempted to put together funding to buy DeepMind. This effort culminated in an hour-long call wherein Mr. Musk and Mr. Nosek made one last effort to convince Mr. Hassabis not to sell DeepMind to Google. Mr. Musk told Mr. Hassabis that [t]he future of AI should not be controlled by Larry [Page].   39. Mr. Musk and Mr. Nosek’s effort was unsuccessful. It was reported in January 2014  that DeepMind would be acquired by Google. However, this did not deter Mr. Musk from continuing to ensure that AI was developed and practiced safely.  40. Following Google’s acquisition of DeepMind, Mr. Musk began hosting his own  series of dinner discussions on ways to counter Google and promote AI safety. Mr. Musk also reached out to President Barack Obama to discuss AI and AI safety. In 2015, Mr. Musk and President Obama had a meeting during which Mr. Musk explained the dangers of AI and advocated for regulation. Mr. Musk felt that President Obama understood the dangers of AI, but regulation never came.  41. Despite these setbacks, Mr. Musk continued to advocate for safe AI practices. In  2015, it appeared that Mr. Musk may have found someone who understood his concerns about AI and his desire to keep the first AGI out of the hands of a private company like Google: Defendant Sam Altman.    42. At this time, Mr. Altman was the president of Y Combinator, a start-up accelerator  in Silicon Valley. Before that, Mr. Altman had been involved in various startup ventures.      – 11 –  COMPLAINT    43. Mr. Altman appeared to share Mr. Musk’s concerns surrounding AI. In public blog  posts dating back to 2014, Mr. Altman stated that AGI, if made, would be the biggest development in technology ever. Mr. Altman pointed out that there are many companies making strides towards achieving AGI, but acknowledged the unfortunate reality that the good ones are very secretive about it.  44. On February 25, 2015, Mr. Altman also expressed his concern surrounding the  development of what he referred to as superhuman machine intelligence which he identified as probably the greatest threat to the continued existence of humanity and emphasized that as a human programmed to survive and reproduce, I feel we should fight it. Further, Mr. Altman criticized those who believed that superhuman machine intelligence was dangerous but dismissed it as never going to happen or definitely very far off. He accused them of engaging in sloppy, dangerous thinking.  45. Indeed, in early March 2015, Mr. Altman extolled the importance of government  regulation as a means to ensure AI is created safely and suggested that a group of very smart people with a lot of resources likely involving US companies in some way would be the most probable group to achieve superhuman machine intelligence first.  46. Later that month, Mr. Altman reached out to Mr. Musk to inquire whether he would  be interested in drafting an open letter to the United States Government regarding AI. The two began  preparing a letter and approaching those of influence in the technology and AI sectors about signing. It did not take long before those across the industry heard rumors of the letter.   47. For example, in April of 2015, Mr. Hassabis reached out to Mr. Musk stating that he  had heard from multiple sources that Mr. Musk wa s drafting a letter addressed to the President  calling for regulation of AI. Mr. Musk defended the idea of the regulation of AI to Mr. Hassabis, stating: If done well, it may very well accelerate AI in the long term. Without the public comfort that regulatory oversight provides, there could very well be a situation where an AI causes great harm and thereafter AI research is banned as dangerous to public safety.  48. Five days after Mr. Hassabis reached out to Mr. Musk about the open letter regarding  AI, Mr. Hassabis announced the first meeting of the Google DeepMind AI Ethics Board, a board   – 12 –  COMPLAINT    that Google and DeepMind promised to establish two years earlier when Google acquired  DeepMind. Mr. Musk was asked to be a member of the board and offered for the first meeting to be hosted at SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. It became clear to Mr. Musk after the first meeting that this board was not a serious endeavor, but was rather a façade to try to slow down any regulation of AI.   49. The Open Letter was later published on October 28, 2015, and signed by over eleven  thousand individuals, including Mr. Musk, Stephen Hawking, and Steve Wozniak.  B. OpenAI, Inc.’s Founding Agreement  50. On May 25, 2015, Mr. Altman emailed Mr. Musk, writing that he had [b]een  thinking a lot about whether it’s possible to stop humanity from developing AI. I think the answer is almost definitely not. If it’s going to happen, it seems like it would be good for someone other than Google to do it first. Mr. Altman had an idea: that Y Combinator start a Manhattan Project for AI. (Unfortunately, it turns out that the Manhattan Project is a moniker that may be all too apt.) He proposed that we could structure it so that the tech belongs to the world via some sort of nonprofit but the people working on it get startup-like compensation if it works. Obviously we’d comply with/aggressively support all regulation. Mr. Musk responded, Probably worth a conversation.  51. After further communications, Mr. Altman emailed Mr. Musk on June 24, 2015 with  a detailed proposal for this new AI lab. The mission would be to create the first general AI and use it for individual empowerment—ie, the distributed version of the future that seems the safest. More generally, safety should be a first-class requirement. The technology would be owned by the foundation and used ‘for the good of the world’[.] He proposed that they start with a group of 7-10 people and expand from there. He also proposed a governance structure. Mr. Musk responded, Agree on all. Ex. 2 at 1.   52. Soon thereafter, Mr. Altman began recruiting others to help with the development of  the project. Notably, Mr. Altman approached Gregory Brockman to help with the project.   53. In November 2015, Mr. Altman put Mr. Brockman in communication with Mr. Musk  via email. Regarding the project, Mr. Brockman told Mr. Musk, I hope for us to enter the field as   – 13 –  COMPLAINT    a neutral group looking to collaborate widely and shift the dialog towards being about humanity  winning rather than any particular group or company. (I think that’s the best way to bootstrap ourselves into being a leading research institution.). Optimistic about the possibility of a neutral AI research group focused on humanity rather than profit for any particular individual or group, Mr. Musk told Mr. Brockman that he would commit funding.  54. Mr. Musk came up with the name of the new lab, a name reflecting the Founding  Agreement: Open AI Institute, or simply, OpenAI.   55. With these principles of the Founding Agreement in mind, Mr. Musk joined forces  with Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman to formalize and launch the project. Mr. Musk was actively involved in the project, even prior to it being publicly announced. For example, Mr. Musk advised Mr. Brockman on compensation packages for employees, sharing with Mr. Brockman his strategies for compensation and retaining talent.   56. On December 8, 2015, a Certificate of Incorporation for OpenAI, Inc. was filed with  the Delaware Secretary of State. The Certificate memorialized in writing the Founding Agreement:  THIRD: This Corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized exclusively for  charitable and/or educational purposes within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the corresponding provision of any future United States Internal Revenue law. The specific purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research, development and distribution of technology related to artificial intelligence. The resulting technology will benefit the public and the corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit  when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person. . . .  FIFTH: The property of this corporation is irrevocably dedicated to the purposes in  Article THREE hereof and no part of the net income or assets of this corporation shall ever inure to the benefit of any director, officer or member thereof or to the benefit of any private person. Upon the dissolution or winding up of this corporation, its assets remaining after payment, or provision for payment, of all debts and liabilities of this corporation shall be distributed to a nonprofit fund, foundation, or corporation which is organized and operated exclusively for charitable, educational and/or religious purposes and which has established its tax exempt status under Internal Revenue Code section 501(c)(3), or the corresponding section of any future federal tax code, or shall be distributed to the federal government, or to a state or local government, for a public purpose.   – 14 –  COMPLAINT    57. OpenAI, Inc. was publicly announced on December 11, 2015. In the announcement,  Mr. Musk and Mr. Altman were named as co-chairs and Mr. Brockman was named as the CTO. The announcement emphasized that OpenAI was designed to benefit humanity, and its research would be free from financial obligation:  OpenAI is a non-profit artificial intelligence research company. Our goal is to  advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return. Since our research is free from financial obligations, we can better focus on a positive human impact.   Ex. 3 at 1.  C. Mr. Musk’s Crucial Role In Getting OpenAI, Inc. Off The Ground  58. In an email on the day of the public announcement, Mr. Musk wrote that [o]ur most  important consideration is recruitment of the best people. He pledged that helping with the recruiting effort would be his absolute top priority 24/7. He acknowledged that [w]e are  outmanned and outgunned by a ridiculous margin by organizations you know well, but we have right on our side and that counts for a lot. I like the odds. Mr. Musk brought to bear his connections, stature and clout in the effort. The fact that OpenAI, Inc. was an Elon Musk-sponsored initiative, and that Mr. Musk served as co-chair, was instrumental to OpenAI, Inc.’s recruiting efforts, particularly in the face of Google/DeepMind’s counter-recruiting. Without Mr. Musk’s involvement and substantial supporting efforts and resources—his consideration for the Founding Agreement—it is highly likely that OpenAI, Inc. would never have gotten off the ground.  59. One of the most important initial hires was for the role of Chief Scientist. Mr.  Altman, Mr. Brockman, and Mr. Musk all wanted Ilya Sutskever, then a research scientist at Google, in that role. Dr. Sutskever went back and forth on whether to leave Google and join the project, but it was ultimately a call from Mr. Musk on the day OpenAI, Inc. was publicly announced that convinced Dr. Sutskever to commit to joining the project as OpenAI, Inc.’s Chief Scientist.   60. Mr. Musk actively recruited for OpenAI, Inc. over the next several months.  Google/DeepMind made increasingly lavish counter-offers to OpenAI, Inc. recruits in an attempt to kill the new venture. In late February, Mr. Musk emailed Mr. Brockman and Mr. Altman, reiterating that [w]e need to do what it takes to get the top talent. Let’s go higher. If, at some point, we need    – 15 –  COMPLAINT    to revisit what existing people are getting paid, that’s fine. Either we get the best people in the world  or we will get whipped by Deepmind. Whatever it takes to bring on ace talent is fin[e] by me. Deepmind is causing me extreme mental stress. If they win, it will be really bad news with their one mind to rule the world philosophy. They are obviously making major progress and well they should, given the talent level over there.  61. Mr. Musk was not just using his connections and clout to recruit on behalf of OpenAI,  Inc. When he told Mr. Brockman and Mr. Altman to go higher in their offers and do what it takes to get the top talent, he was the one funding those higher offers. In 2016 alone, Mr. Musk contributed over $15 million dollars to OpenAI, Inc., more than any other donor. The funding he provided enabled OpenAI, Inc. to assemble a team of top talent. Similarly, in 2017, Mr. Musk contributed nearly $20 million dollars to OpenAI, Inc., again, more than any other donor. All told, Mr. Musk contributed more than $44 million to OpenAI, Inc. between 2016 and September 2020.   62. In addition, through Musk Industries LLC, Mr. Musk leased OpenAI, Inc.’s initial  office space in the Pioneer Building in San Francisco and paid the monthly rental expenses. Mr. Musk regularly visited OpenAI, Inc., and was present for important company milestones, such as when the first DGX-1 AI supercomputer was donated to OpenAI, Inc. in 2016. Mr. Musk would receive updates on OpenAI, Inc.’s progress and would provide his feedback and advice.  D. Mr. Altman And Mr. Brockman Repeatedly Reaffirm The Founding Agreement  63. In 2017, Mr. Brockman and others suggested transforming OpenAI, Inc. from a non- profit to a for-profit corporation. After a series of communications over several weeks, Mr. Musk told Mr. Brockman, Dr. Sutskever, and Mr. Altman [e]ither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit. I will no longer fund OpenAI until you have made a firm commitment to stay or I’m just being a fool who is essentially providing free funding to a startup. Discussions are over.   64. In response, Mr. Altman told Mr. Musk [I] remain enthusiastic about the non-profit  structure! Ultimately, Mr. Brockman and Mr. Sustkever conveyed to Mr. Musk that they, too, were resolved to continuing the non-profit structure, and that they would spend the next year committed to fundraising to support the non-profit.      – 16 –  COMPLAINT    65. On February 21, 2018, Mr. Musk stepped down as a co-chair of OpenAI, Inc.  Nevertheless, Mr. Musk continued making contributions to OpenAI, Inc. relying on, and in furtherance of, the Founding Agreement. For example, in 2018, Mr. Musk donated approximately $3.5 million to OpenAI, Inc. He also continued receiving updates about OpenAI, Inc. from Mr. Brockman, Dr. Sutskever, and Mr. Altman.   66. In April 2018, Mr. Altman sent Mr. Musk a draft OpenAI Charter and solicited his  feedback. The draft charter described OpenAI’s mission as to ensure that AGI benefits all of humanity. It stated, We commit to use any influence we obtain over AGI’s deployment to ensure it is used for the benefit of all, and to avoid enabling uses of AI or AGI that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power. Our primary fiduciary duty is to  humanity. We anticipate needing to marshal  substantial resources to fulfill our mission, but will always assiduously act to minimize conflicts of interest . . . that could compromise broad benefit.  67. On March 11, 2019, OpenAI, Inc. announced that it would be creating a for-profit  subsidiary: OpenAI, L.P. Prospective investors were notified of an important warning at the top of the summary term sheet that the for-profit entity exists to advance OpenAI Inc.’s [the non-profit’s] mission of ensuring that safe artificial gene ral intelligence is developed and benefits all of  humanity. The General Partner’s duty to this mission and the principles advanced in the OpenAI Inc. Charter take precedence over any obligation to generate a profit. Accordingly, investors were expressly advised that [i]t would be wise to view any investment in OpenAI LP in the spirit of a donation.   68. Following the announcement, Mr. Musk reached out to Mr. Altman asking him to  be explicit that I have no financial interest in the for-profit arm of OpenAI. However, Mr. Musk continued to support OpenAI, Inc., the non-profit, donating an additional $3.48 million in 2019.   69. On September 22, 2020, OpenAI announced that it exclusively licensed certain of its  pre-AGI technology to Microsoft. Consistent with the Founding Agreement, OpenAI’s website states that AGI, which it describes as a highly autonomous system that outperforms humans at most economically valuable work is excluded from IP licenses and other commercial terms with    – 17 –  COMPLAINT    Microsoft, which only apply to pre-AGI technology. However, OpenAI’s Board determines when  we’ve attained AGI.   E. OpenAI’s Shifting Corporate Structure  70. In the years following the announcement of the OpenAI, L.P., OpenAI’s corporate  structure became increasingly complex. OpenAI, L.L.C. was formed in Delaware on September 17, 2020. OpenAI, L.L.C.’s sole member is OpenAI OpCo, LLC.   71. OpenAI OpCo, LLC was formed in Delaware on September 19, 2018, and its sole  member is OpenAI Global, LLC.   72. OpenAI Global, LLC was formed in Delaware on December 28, 2022. On  information and belief, OpenAI Global, LLC, like OpenAI, L.P., is a capped for-profit entity. OpenAI Global, LLC has two members: Microsoft Corporation and OAI Corporation, LLC.   73. OAI Corporation, LLC is a limited liability company formed in Delaware. The sole  member of OAI Corporation, LLC is OpenAI Holdings, LLC.   74. OpenAI Holdings, LLC was formed in Delaware on March 17, 2023, and has  multiple members including OpenAI, Inc., Aestas, LLC, and various individual members.   75. On information and belief, OpenAI, Inc. manages OpenAI, L.P. and OpenAI Global,  LLC through its general partner, OpenAI GP, L.L.C., which was registered as a limited liability company in Delaware on September 19, 2018. OpenAI GP, L.L.C. is wholly owned by OpenAI, Inc. (the non-profit), and is controlled by the non-profit’s Board of Directors. Under OpenAI’s charter, the Board has no fiduciary duties to share holders; rather, its sole fiduciary duty is to  humanity.   76. On information and belief, at least OpenAI, L.P. and OpenAI GP LLC were initially  established to facilitate and fund OpenAI, Inc.’s non-profit mission as set forth in the Founding Agreement.    F. The Development Of OpenAI’s Technology—From AI To AGI  77. Initial work at OpenAI followed much in the footsteps of DeepMind. OpenAI used  reinforcement learning to play a game. Instead of playing chess, however, OpenAI competed in Dota 2, a strategy video game with far more moving pieces than chess. OpenAI’s team quickly    – 18 –  COMPLAINT    constructed a new model that beat the reigning world champion team, demonstrating that self-play  reinforcement learning can achieve superhuman performance on a difficult task.  78. Meanwhile, at Google, an algorithm called the Transformer was created that solved  many of the issues deep learning had faced in understanding long sequences of text. This algorithm, an example of a large-language model, was developed to translate text from one language to another and works by forming connections between words in the source language and mapping those connections to the target language.  79. Researchers at OpenAI continued this research and quickly produced yet another  startling result: by using the first half of Google’s Transformer architecture, a deep neural network could be pre-trained on a large corpus of text and used to generate new text. In January 2018, OpenAI released the source code and trained model for this Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) along with a detailed paper describing the model and its capabilities   80. In 2019, OpenAI released a second-generation model, GPT-2. The release was again  accompanied by a detailed paper describing the model and noting that unlike previous models, which needed to be trained on a specific task, [w]hen a large language model is trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset it is able to perform well across many domains and datasets. These models were proving themselves to be very different from previous AI systems. Instead of training the system to perform a particular task, they could be simply asked to perform a new task in natural language.    81. As contemplated by the Founding Agreement, OpenAI publicly released the full  version of GPT-2. Notably, it did so despite the fact that humans find GPT-2 outputs convincing, that GPT-2 can be fine-tuned for misuse, and that detection [of GPT generated text] is challenging. At the time, OpenAI stated that it was releasing the full, open version with the hope that it will be useful to developers of future powerful models. This release was accompanied by a detailed paper co-authored by OpenAI scientists as well as independent social and technical scientists. This paper explained just some of the many benefits that came from releasing models publically as opposed to keeping them closed.    – 19 –  COMPLAINT    82. Their publication did prove to be useful to the developers of future, powerful models.  Entire communities sprung up to enhance and extend the models released by OpenAI. These communities spread to open-source, grass-r oots efforts and commercial entities alike.  83. In 2020, OpenAI announced a third version of its model, GPT-3. It used 175 billion  parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model. Again, OpenAI announced the development of this model with the publication of a research paper describing its complete implementation for others to build on.  84. In 2022, researchers at Google took these results and showed that a small change  called chain-of-thought prompting could enable large language models to perform complex reasoning. Researchers at the University of Tokyo and Google quickly expanded on Google’s results and showed that OpenAI’s GPT-3 could reason about an entirely new problem in a step-by-step manner, like a human, by simply adding ‘Let’s think step by step’ before each answer.   85. A path to Artificial Generative Intelligence could be seen. And the timeline to it was  dramatically compressing.  86. On March 14, 2023, OpenAI released a new generation of its model, GPT-4. This  generation was not just capable of reasoning but was better at reasoning than average humans.   GPT-4 scored in the 90th percentile on the Uniform Bar Exam. It scored in the 99th percentile on  the GRE Verbal Assessment. It even scored a 77% on the Advanced Sommelier examination. By OpenAI’s own objective measures, GPT-4 is already ca pable of intelligence that is superior to  humans on a wide variety of economically valuable tasks.  87. This development was not lost on the research community. In a detailed analysis  titled Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence: Ear ly experiments with GPT-4, Microsoft  researchers note that GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4’s performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as [GPT-3.5 based] ChatGPT.     88. They compared the performance of GPT-4 with the performance of GPT-3 based  systems and found that there is no comparison with the outputs from GPT-4. On mathematical    – 20 –  COMPLAINT    problems, they show that [t]he solution given by GPT-4 is correct and the argument is sound, while  ChatGPT [based on GPT-3] produces an incorrect solution which (in the case of a human) would reflect a lack of understanding of the concept of function inversion. On another example, they show that GPT-4 gives a correct solution while ChatGPT begins by rearranging the terms without any clear direction or purpose, and ends up with an incorrect solution.  89. Microsoft’s own scientists acknowledge that GPT-4 attains a form of general  intelligence and that [g]iven the breadth and de pth of GPT-4’s capabilities, we believe that it could  reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomp lete) version of an artif icial general intelligence  (AGI) system.  G. The Founding Agreement Is Breached In 2023  90. Having reached the threshold of AGI, which under the Founding Agreement they  were to develop for the benefit of humanity rather than for any for-profit company or personal profit, Defendants instead radically departed from their mission in breach of the Founding Agreement. GPT-4 is an entirely closed model. The internal design of GPT-4 remains a secret and no code has been released. OpenAI has not published a paper describing any aspect of its internal design; it has simply issued press releases boasting about its performance. The internal details of GPT-4 are known only to OpenAI and, on information and belief, to Microsoft. GPT-4 is hence the opposite of open AI. And it is closed for propriety commercial reasons: Microsoft stands to make a fortune selling GPT-4 to the public, which would not be possible if OpenAI—as it is required to do—makes the technology freely available to the public. Contrary to the Founding Agreement, Defendants have chosen to use GPT-4 not for the benefit of humanity, but as proprietary technology to maximize profits for literally the largest company in the wo rld. Further, OpenAI’s entire development is now  veiled in secrecy and the public only has rumors and isolated fragments of communications to understand what may be released next.   91. Researchers have pointed out that one of the remaining limitations of GPT  architecture-based AIs is that they generate their output a piece at a time and cannot backtrack. These issues have been seen before in artificial intelligence research and have been largely solved for other applications. In path and maze finding, AI must be able to find the right path despite the     – 21 –  COMPLAINT    existence of dead-ends along the way. The standard algorithm to perform this is called A  (pronounced A-star).  92. Reuters has reported that OpenAI is developing a secretive algorithm called Q.  While it is not clear what Q is, Reuters has reported that several OpenAI staff members wrote a letter warning about the potential power of Q. It appears Q may now or in the future be a part of an even clearer and more striking example of artificial general intelligence that has been developed by OpenAI. As an AGI, it would be explicitly outside the scope of OpenAI’s license with Microsoft, and must be made available for the benefit of the public at large.  93. For purposes of the license with Microsoft, OpenAI, Inc.’s Board determines whether  OpenAI has attained AGI, and in a series of shocking developments described in more detail below, a majority of OpenAI, Inc.’s Board was forced to resign on November 22, 2023, and their replacements were, on information and belief, handpicked by Mr. Altman and Microsoft.  94. On November 17, 2023, OpenAI, Inc.’s Board dismissed Mr. Altman. OpenAI  announced in a blog post that Mr. Altman had been fired and his departure follows a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.   95. Mr. Brockman was also removed from the Board but was told he would retain his  role at OpenAI.   96. At the time, the Board consisted of Helen Toner, Adam D’Angelo, Tasha McCauley,  Dr. Sutskever, Mr. Brockman, and Mr. Altman. In addition to serving on the Board, Ms. Toner is a researcher and advisor for the Center for the Governance of AI (GovAI) and the Director of Strategy  at Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology. Ms. McCauley is a Senior Management Scientist at RAND Corporation, a nonprofit which specializes in public policy decision making. She is also an advisor for GovAI. Mr. D’Angelo—the only board member to remain after Mr. Altman’s reinstatement—is a tech CEO and entrepreneur.   97. The choice to include on OpenAI, Inc.’s Board multiple academics and public policy  experts with deep AI policy experience, most of whom had no financial stake in the company, was     – 22 –  COMPLAINT    deliberate. This composition of financially disinterested Board members with strong records of  public service ensured that the Board would put the nonprofit’s principal beneficiary—humanity—before financial success. This safeguard was put in place for the Board in furtherance of OpenAI, Inc.’s non-profit mission and the Founding Agreement: to safely create AGI which would benefit humanity, not the pecuniary interests of a for-profit company.   98. On information and belief, Mr. Altman’s firing was due in part to OpenAI’s  breakthrough in realizing AGI. In fact, news reports suggested that there was a rift among OpenAI Board members and executives regarding safety concerns and the potential threat posed by OpenAI’s next generation Q.  99. News of Mr. Altman’s ouster spread rapidly. Following the Board’s announcement  that Mr. Altman was fired, Mr. Brockman announced he would be leaving OpenAI with Mr. Altman.   100. When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella learned of Mr. Altman’s firing, he was  reportedly furious. As a 49% shareholder in OpenAI’s for-profit arm, Mr. Nadella felt that Microsoft should have been consulted before Mr. Altman’s firing. However, at this time, outside of Mr. Altman, OpenAI, Inc.’s Board had no ties to Microsoft, and no fiduciary duty to investors in the for-profit arm. Rather, on information and belief, Mr. Altman was the primary liaison between Microsoft and OpenAI, Inc.   101. Mr. Nadella invited Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman to lead a new Microsoft AI  research lab, unbound by the constraints of OpenAI, Inc.’s humanitarian mission. Nadella made it clear that employees who left OpenAI would be welcome at Microsoft’s new lab with the same salary.  102. Microsoft was confident that, through its substantial ownership in OpenAI’s for- profit arm, it could completely sequester OpenAI, Inc.’s research should the company cease to exist. Indeed, during an interview shortly after Mr. Altman’s firing, Mr. Nadella stated:  [W]e were very confident in our own ability. We have all the IP rights and all the  capability. If OpenAI disappeared tomorrow, I don’t want any customer of ours to be worried about it quite honestly, because we have all of the rights to continue the innovation. Not just to serve the product, but we can go and just do what we were doing in partnership ourselves. We have the people, we have the compute, we have the data, we have everything.    – 23 –  COMPLAINT    103. Despite Microsoft’s statements regarding their capability to function without  OpenAI, Microsoft never abandoned its plan to secure the reinstatement of Mr. Altman as OpenAI, Inc.’s CEO. In the days following Mr. Altman’s firing, OpenAI, Inc.’s Board was faced with mounting pressure from lawyers and major shareholders, including Microsoft, to reinstate Mr. Altman.  104. Ms. Toner was specifically targeted in efforts to reinstate Mr. Altman. During these  efforts, a lawyer for OpenAI told Ms. Toner that she and the Board could face claims for breach of their fiduciary duties to investors should OpenAI fail due to Mr. Altman’s firing.   105. However, the OpenAI, Inc. Board has never had a fiduciary duty to investors. In fact,  all investors in the for-profit arm are told that the company’s duty to its mission takes precedence over its duty to its investors, and OpenAI, Inc.’s we bsite clearly indicates it only holds a fiduciary  duty to humanity.   106. Ms. Toner, who described the lawyer’s actions as an intimidation tactic, opined that  Mr. Altman’s continued removal would in fact advance the company’s mission by promoting the safety of humanity over profit. However, none of this dissuaded the shareholders and Mr. Altman from pushing for his reinstatement.   107. Further, Microsoft had substantial coercive power over OpenAI, Inc. and its Board.  During the period of Mr. Altman’s firing, CEO Nadella said the following of Microsoft’s relationship with OpenAI:  We are in there. We are below them, a bove them, around them. We do the kernel  optimizations, we build tools, we build the infrastructure. So that’s why I think a lot of the industrial analysts are saying, Oh wow, it’s really a joint project between Microsoft and OpenAI. The reality is we are, as I said, very self-sufficient in all of this.  108. Moreover, at the time of the firing, Microsoft had only paid a fraction of a $10 billion  investment commitment it had made to OpenAI, giving Microsoft serious leverage over the independent non-profit Board. Additionally, if Microsoft withheld its cloud computing system on which OpenAI was reliant, the company would be incapacitated.   109. The pressure on the Board from Mr. Altman and Microsoft continued until  November 21, when Mr. Altman was reinstated as the CEO of OpenAI, Inc. and Mr. Brockman re-    – 24 –  COMPLAINT    joined as President. One of Mr. Altman’s conditions upon return was that Ms. Toner, Ms. McCauley,  and Dr. Sutskever resign from the Board.  110. On information and belief, following his return, Mr. Altman hand-picked a new  Board that lacks similar technical expertise or any substantial background in AI governance, which the previous board had by design. Mr. D’Angelo, a tech CEO and entrepreneur, was the only member of the previous board to remain after Mr. Altman’s return. The new Board consisted of members with more experience in profit-centric enterprises or politics than in AI ethics and governance. They were also reportedly big fans of Altman. Two of the new board members were Bret Taylor and Larry Summers. Mr. Taylor is no stranger to Silicon Valley, and has been heavily involved in various Bay Area profit-driven ventures. On February 14, 2024, Mr. Taylor and ex-Google executive Clay Bavor launched a startup focused on building AI chatbots for businesses. Dr. Summers is an economist who, on information and belief, had no experience working in artificial intelligence-based ventures prior to November 2023. Microsoft also obtained an observer seat on the Board from which it could keep a close eye on its ostensibly non-profit golden goose.  111. With the reinstatement of Mr. Altman and the restructuring of the Board, OpenAI’s  corporate structure that had been designed as a system of checks and balances between the non-profit arm, for-profit arm, the Board, and the CEO to ensure the non-profit mission was being carried out, collapsed overnight. OpenAI, Inc.’s once carefully crafted non-profit structure was replaced by a purely profit-driven CEO and a Board with inferior technical expertise in AGI and AI public policy. The Board now has an observer seat reserved solely for Microsoft. With this restructuring, OpenAI, Inc. abandoned its non-profit mission of developing AGI for the benefit of humanity broadly, thereby keeping it out of the hands of a large for-profit corporation in which vast power would be unduly concentrated.  112. The OpenAI, Inc. Board’s technical expertise in AI, neutrality, and commitment to  OpenAI, Inc.’s nonprofit mission are particularly essential to OpenAI, Inc.’s mission as it is the Board that determines whether OpenAI has attained  AGI for purposes of its license agreement with  Microsoft. This means that the Board is tasked with determining whether OpenAI’s most powerful and advanced technology is actually excluded from the scope of Microsoft’s exclusive license.      – 25 –  COMPLAINT    Given Microsoft’s enormous financial interest in keeping the gate closed to the public, OpenAI,  Inc.’s new captured, conflicted, and compliant Board will have every reason to delay ever making a finding that OpenAI has attained AGI. To the contrary, OpenAI’s attainment of AGI, like Tomorrow in Annie , will always be a day away, ensuring that Microsoft will be licensed to  OpenAI’s latest technology and the public will be shut out, precisely the opposite of the Founding Agreement.  113. OpenAI’s conduct could have seismic implications for Silicon Valley and, if allowed  to stand, could represent a paradigm shift for technology start-ups. It is important to reflect on what has transpired here: a non-profit startup has collected tens of millions of dollars in contributions for  the express purpose of developing AGI technology for public benefit, and shortly before achieving the very milestone that the company was created to achieve, the company has become a closed, for-profit partner of the world’s largest corporation, thereby personally enriching the Defendants. If this business model were valid, it would radically redefine how venture capitalism is practiced in California and beyond. Rather than start out as a for-profit entity from the outset, smart investors would establish non-profits, use pre-tax donations to fund research and development, and then once their technology had been developed and proven, would slide the resulting IP assets into a new for- profit venture to enrich themselves and their profit-maximizing corporate partners. That is not supposed to be how the law works in California or anywhere else in this country, and this should not be the first Court to hold otherwise.  114. To further understand why this is important, if OpenAI’s new business model is  valid, for every dollar that an investor invests by contributing to a non-profit, that investor gets approximately 50 cents back from the state and federal governments in the form of reduced income taxes, so the net cost to them of each $1 of investment is only 50 cents. However, with OpenAI’s new business model, they get the same for profit upside as those who invest the conventional way in for-profit corporations and thus do not get an immediate tax write off, financed by the government and, ultimately, the public. From an investment perspective, competing against an entity employing the new OpenAI business model would be like playing a game of basketball where the other team’s baskets are worth twice as many points. If this Court validates OpenAI’s conduct here, any start-up     – 26 –  COMPLAINT    seeking to remain competitive in Silicon Valley would essentially be required to follow this OpenAI  playbook, which would become standard operating procedure for start-ups to the detriment of legitimate non-profits, the government’s tax coffers, and ultimately the people of California and beyond. Notably, OpenAI’s for-profit arm was recently valued at nearly $80 billion.  H. November 2023 To Present: Altman’s OpenAI  115. The public is still in the dark regarding what exactly the Board’s deliberative review  process revealed that resulted in the initial firing of Mr. Altman. However, one thing is clear to Mr.  Musk and the public at large: OpenAI has abandoned its irrevocable non-profit mission in the pursuit of profit. Numerous leaders and intellectuals have publicly commented on the irony and tragedy of OpenAI becoming Closed, For-Profit AI.  116. For example, on November 29, 2023, MIT economists wrote an opinion in the L.A.  Times expressing concern with OpenAI’s new profit -driven directive. In their words, [d]isruption  and uncontrolled growth have become religion for the tech industry, and Altman has been one of its most dedicated high priests. The economists emphasized the new Board is far more likely to allow Mr. Altman to scale up OpenAI as quickly as possible, no matter the severity of societal costs.   117. The president of Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer advocacy organization, wrote  an open letter to California Attorney General Rob Bonta earlier this year raising concerns about whether OpenAI’s for-profit subsidiary is exerting inappropriate control over the non-profit, or whether the non-profit’s purpose had shifted to profit-making under Mr. Altman and Microsoft. The letter suggested that should the non-profit abandon its original mission, it should be dissolved with proceeds going to another charitable enterprise.   118. A WIRED investigation from January 2024 found that OpenAI has also recently  shuttered the public’s access to previously available key documents. In line with OpenAI’s original promise of transparency, OpenAI’s IRS documents have indicated since its founding that any member of the public may view copies of its governing documents, financial statements, and conflict of interest rules. However, when WIRED requested these documents, OpenAI indicated it had changed its policy. Thus, while OpenAI has l ong touted its commitment to transparency,    – 27 –  COMPLAINT    members of the public are unable to obtain information shedding light on the incidents of November  2023.   119. Access to OpenAI’s documents could inform the public whether it has changed its  governance to appease Microsoft and other shareholders. At the very least, changes had to be made to accommodate Microsoft’s seat on the Board, and now Mr. Altman is reportedly in discussions with Middle Eastern investors to raise up to $7 tr illion in an effort develop a global network of AI  chip fabrication plants. If $10 billion from Microsoft was enough to get it a seat on the Board, one can only imagine how much influence over OpenAI, Inc. these new potential investments could confer on the investors. This is especially troubling when one potential donor is the national security advisor of the United Arab Emirates, and United States officials are concerned due to the United Arab Emirates’ ties to China. Moreover, Mr. Altman has been quoted discussing the possibility of making the United Arab Emirates a regulatory sandbox where AI technologies are tested.   120. Further, access to OpenAI’s conflict-of-interest policy is important to shed light on  the Board’s ability to control Mr. Altman’s use of OpenAI to advance his own economic interests, which so far appear to have gone unchecked. For example, in 2019 when Mr. Altman was CEO, OpenAI signed a letter of intent to buy $51 million worth of chips from a start-up in which Mr. Altman was heavily invested.  121. While OpenAI, Inc. was once a pioneer of safe, responsible development of AGI  based on open communication with the public, it has now shut its doors, brought the biggest investor of its for-profit subsidiary onto a Board which owes its only fiduciary duty to humanity, and continues in secrecy towards a profit-centric future with possible calamitous implications for humanity.   122. Mr. Musk founded and funded OpenAI, Inc. with Mr. Altman and Mr. Brockman in  exchange for and relying on the Founding Agreement to ensure that AGI would benefit humanity, not for-profit corporations. As events turned out in 2023, his contributions to OpenAI, Inc. have been twisted to benefit the Defendants and the biggest company in the world. This was a stark betrayal of the Founding Agreement, turning that Agreement on its head and perverting OpenAI, Inc.’s mission. Imagine donating to a non-profit whose asserted mission is to protect the Amazon     – 28 –  COMPLAINT    rainforest, but then the non-profit creates a for-profit Amazonian logging company that uses the  fruits of the donations to clear the rainforest. That is the story of OpenAI, Inc.   FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION  Breach of Contract   Against All Defendants  123. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint  necessary for his claim of Breach of Contract.   124. From OpenAI, Inc.’s founding in 2015 through September 2020, Plaintiff  contributed tens of millions of dollars, provided integral advice on research directions, and played a key role in recruiting world-class talent to OpenAI, Inc. in exchange and as consideration for the Founding Agreement, namely, that: OpenAI, Inc. (a) would be a non-profit developing AGI for the benefit of humanity, not for a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits; and (b) would be open-source, balancing only countervailing safety considerations, and would not keep its technology closed and secret for proprietary commercial reasons. This Founding Agreement is memorialized in, among other places, OpenAI, Inc.’s founding Articles of Incorporation and in numerous written communications between Plaintiff and Defendants over a multi-year period, such as:   a. The specific purpose of this corporation is to provide funding for research,  development and distribution of technology related to artificial intelligence. The resulting technology will benefit the public and the corporation will seek to open source technology for the public benefit when applicable. The corporation is not organized for the private gain of any person. Ex. 1 at 1.   b. Mr. Altman stated: The mission would be to create the first general AI and use it  for individual empowerment—ie, the distributed version of the future that seems the safest. More generally, safety should be a first-class requirement. . . . The technology would be owned by the foundation and used ‘for the good of the world’[.] Plaintiff replied: Agree on all. Ex. 2 at 1.     – 29 –  COMPLAINT    125. Defendants have breached the Founding Agreement in multiple separate and  independent ways, including at least by:   a. Licensing GPT-4, which Microsoft’s own scientists have written can reasonably  be viewed as an early (yet still incomp lete) version of an artificial general  intelligence (AGI) system, exclusively to Microsoft, despite agreeing that OpenAI would develop AGI for the benefit of humanity, not for the private commercial gain of a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits, much less the largest corporation in the world.   b. Failing to disclose to the public, among other things, details on GPT-4’s  architecture, hardware, training method, and training computation, and further by erecting a paywall between the public and GPT-4, requiring per-token payment for usage, in order to advance Defendants and Microsoft’s own private commercial interests, despite agreeing that OpenAI’s technology would be open-source, balancing only countervailing safety considerations.   c. Permitting Microsoft, a publicly traded for-profit corporation, to occupy a seat on  OpenAI, Inc.’s Board of Directors and exert undue influence and control over OpenAI’s non-profit activities including, for example, the determination of whether and to what extent to make OpenAI, Inc.’s technology freely available and open to the public and the determination of whether OpenAI has attained AGI.   126. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ breaches, Plaintiff has suffered  damages in an amount that is presently unknown, but that substantially exceeds this Court’s jurisdictional minimum of $35,000, and, if necessary, will be proven at trial.   127. Plaintiff also seeks and is entitled to specific performance of Defendant’s contractual  obligations.      – 30 –  COMPLAINT    SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION   Promissory Estoppel   Against All Defendants  128. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint  necessary for his claim of Promissory Estoppel.   129. In order to induce Plaintiff to make millions of dollars in contributions to OpenAI,  Inc. over a period of years, and to induce him to provide substantial time and other resources to get OpenAI, Inc. off the ground as alleged herein, Defendants repeatedly promised Plaintiff, including in writing, that OpenAI (a) would be a non-profit developing AGI for the benefit of humanity, not for a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits; and (b) would be open-source, balancing only countervailing safety considerations, and would not keep its technology closed and secret for proprietary commercial reasons.   130. In doing so, Defendants reasonably expected that Plaintiff would (as he did) rely on  their promises and provide funding, time and other resources to OpenAI, Inc.   131. Plaintiff reasonably relied on Defendants’ false promises to his detriment, ultimately  providing tens of millions of dollars of funding to OpenAI, Inc., as well as his time and other resources, on the condition that OpenAI would remain a non-profit irrevocably dedicated to creating safe, open-source AGI for public benefit, only to then have OpenAI abandon its irrevocable non-profit mission, stop providing basic information to the public, and instead exclusively dedicate and license its AGI algorithms to the largest for-profit company in the world, precisely the opposite of the promises Defendants made to Plaintiff.   132. Injustice can only be avoided through the enforcement of Defendants’ repeated  promises. If specific enforcement is not awarded, then Defendants must at minimum make restitution in an amount equal to Plaintiffs’ contributions that have been misappropriated and by the amount that the intended third-party beneficiaries of the Founding Agreement have been damaged, which is an amount presently unknown, and if necessary, will be proven at trial, but that substantially exceeds this Court’s jurisdictional minimum of $35,000.      – 31 –  COMPLAINT    THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION  Breach of Fiduciary Duty   Against All Defendants   133. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint  necessary for his claim of Breach of Fiduciary Duty.  134. Under California law, Defendants owe fiduciary duties to Plaintiff, including a duty  to use Plaintiff’s contributions for the purposes for which they were made. E.g., Cal. Bus. & Prof.  Code § 17510.8. Defendants have repeatedly breached their fiduciary duties to Plaintiff, including by:   a. Using monies received from Plaintiff, and by using intellectual property and  derivative works funded by those monies, for for-profit purposes that directly contravene both the letter and the express intent of the parties’ agreement, thereby breaching Defendants’ contractual promises to Plaintiff, and also breaching Defendants’ promises to the express intended third-party beneficiaries of the parties’ agreement, i.e., the public. For example, Defendants caused GPT-4, which  Microsoft’s own scientists have written can reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial ge neral intelligence (AGI) system, to be  exclusively licensed to Microsoft, in derogation of OpenAI, Inc.’s irrevocable non-profit mission to develop AGI for the benefit of humanity.   b. Failing to disclose to the public, among other things, details on GPT-4’s  architecture, hardware, training method, and training computation, and further by erecting a paywall between the public and GPT-4, requiring per-token payment for usage, in order to advance Defendants and Microsoft’s own private commercial interests, despite agreeing that OpenAI’s technology would be open-source, balancing only countervailing safety considerations.  c. Permitting Microsoft, a publicly traded for-profit corporation, to occupy a seat on  OpenAI, Inc.’s Board of Directors and exert undue influence and control over OpenAI, Inc.’s non-profit activities including, for example, the determination of     – 32 –  COMPLAINT    whether and to what extent to make OpenAI’s technology freely available to the  public.   135. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty, Plaintiff  and the express intended third-party beneficiaries of the Founding Agreement have suffered damages in an amount that is presently unknown, but substantially exceeds this Court’s jurisdictional minimum of $35,000, and if necessary, will be proven at trial.   136. Plaintiff seeks and is entitled to specific performance of Defendant’s contractual  obligations as a remedy for Defendants’ breaches of fiduciary duty.   FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION   Unfair Business Practices - Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code §§ 17200 et seq.  Against All Defendants   137. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint  necessary for his claim of Unfair Business Practices.  138. California Business and Professions Code sections 17200 et seq. provides that any  person or entity that engages, has engaged, or proposes to engage in unfair business practices may be enjoined.  139. Defendants have engaged in unfair comp etition and other unfair business practices  by soliciting donations from Plaintiff and others under the false pretense that all such funds would be used for the Fundamental Purposes articulated in the Founding Agreement.    140. But for Defendants’ unfair competition and other unfair business practices, Plaintiff  would not have made his donations or other contributions to OpenAI, Inc.   141. As a result of Defendants’ conduct, Plaintiff has been deceived and other members  of the public are likely to be deceived.   142. In engaging in the acts of unfair competition, as alleged above, Defendants violated  at least Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17510.8.  143. As a direct and proximate result of these and other acts of Defendants, Plaintiff has  suffered damages and is entitled to recover all proceeds and compensation received by Defendants      – 33 –  COMPLAINT    and by those acting in concert with them arising from these acts of unfair competition and other  unfair business practices.   144. Plaintiff is entitled to restitution and/or disgorgement of any and all monies received  by Defendants while they engaged in such practices, in addition to prejudgment interest pursuant to Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq.  Plaintiff further seeks to enjoin Defendants from  carrying out such activities again in the future, and an order compelling specific performance.    FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION   Accounting   Against All Defendants   145. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference only paragraphs of this Complaint  necessary for his claim of Accounting.  146. As discussed above, over the course of multiple years, Defendants solicited tens of  millions of dollars in donations from Plaintiff with representations and assurances that OpenAI, Inc. would remain a non-profit irrevocably dedicated to creating safe AGI for public benefit, and that all donated funds would be used in accordance with that irrevocable mandate. On information and belief, Defendants also solicited tens of millions of dollars in donations from others based on the same representations.    147. Contrary to the express purpose for which Plaintiff’s funds were contributed, as set  forth herein, Defendants used monies received from Plaintiff, and intellectual property and derivative works funded by those monies, for for-profit purposes, including for the benefit of private individuals and likely of the individual Defendants themselves, that directly contravene both the letter and the express intent of the parties’ agreement.    148. Because Defendants are in possession of financial information relating to the use of  the charitable contributions that Plaintiff and others made to OpenAI, Inc. and the intellectual property and derivative works funded by those monies, Plaintiff is presently unable to ascertain his interest in or the use, allocation, or distribution of assets without an accounting. Plaintiff is therefore entitled to an accounting.      – 34 –  COMPLAINT    PRAYER FOR RELIEF   WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against Defendants as follows:  A. For an order compelling specific performance of Defendants’ repeated contractual  promises including, without limitation,   i. An order requiring that Defendants continue to follow OpenAI’s long- standing practice of making AI research and technology developed at OpenAI available to the public, and  ii. An order prohibiting Defendants from utilizing OpenAI, Inc. or its assets  for the financial benefit of the individual Defendants, Microsoft, or any other particular person or entity;  B. For a judicial determination that GPT-4 constitutes Artificial General Intelligence  and is thereby outside the scope of OpenAI’s license to Microsoft;  C. For a judicial determination that Q and/or other OpenAI next generation large  language models in development constitute(s) Artificial General Intelligence and is/are outside the scope of OpenAI’s license to Microsoft;  D. Injunctive relief consistent with and to effectuate items A through C above;  E. For an award of restitution and/or disgorgement of any and all monies received by  Defendants while they engaged in the unfair and improper practices described herein, in addition to prejudgment interest and penalties, pursuant to Business & Professions Code § 17200 et seq. ;  F. For an accounting of funds donated by Plaintiffs and others to OpenAI, Inc., and of  intellectual property or derivative works funded by same, and of Defendants’ use of the same for personal benefit or the benefit of any individual or third-party entity;  G. For general, compensatory, and punitive damages to be proven at trial, each of  which Plaintiff will contribute to a non-profit or charity;  H. For attorneys’ fees pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5;  I. For pre-judgment and post-judgment interest at the maximum legal rate; and  J. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.      – 35 –  COMPLAINT    DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL   Plaintiff hereby demands trial by jury as to all issues, claims, and/or causes of action properly  triable before a jury    DATED: February 29, 2024 IRELL & MANELLA LLP     By:                                                                  Morgan Chu  Alan Heinrich Iian Jablon Abigail Sellers Justin Koo Henry White  Attorneys for Plaintiff Elon Musk     Exhibit 1  (9 12/08/2015 11:21 AM 14154847068 + 13027393812  State of Delaware  Secretary of State  Division of Corporations  Delivered 02:22 PM 12/08/2015  FILED 02:22 PM 12/08/2015  SR 20151247198 -FileNumber 5902936 CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF  A NON-STOCK CORPORATION  OPENAI, INC.
